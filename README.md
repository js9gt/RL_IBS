## About

The IQVIA data for a single patient has been uploaded as an excel file along with a user guide.

Excel Outputs are in the Outputs folder, code is in the Scripts folder.

Goal is to first characterize a single patient trajectory and understand their path before adding other patients. Eventually, we want to utilize markov decision processes for specific patient treatments.
